## üö® COMMON PITFALLS TO AVOID

1. **Don't try to build everything at once** - Follow the phased approach
2. **Test early and often** - Don't wait until the end to test integrations
3. **Keep it simple first** - Add complexity gradually
4. **Document as you go** - Update API docs with each change
5. **Focus on one role at a time** - Master customer flow before vendor flow

---

## üí° DEVELOPMENT TIPS

1. **Start Small**: Begin with basic vendor registration, don't worry about advanced features initially
2. **Use Your Plan**: Your existing plan is excellent - reference it for detailed implementation
3. **Test Frequently**: Test each component as you build it
4. **Ask Questions**: When stuck, break down the problem into smaller pieces
5. **Stay Organized**: Use TODOs and track progress regularly

---

**You have an excellent foundation and a solid plan. The key now is systematic execution. Start with Week 1 tasks and build momentum! üöÄ**
